## Build/release

```sh
git archive -o source-code.tar.gz master && git archive -o source-code.zip master && env DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t roborally:dev .
docker run --rm -p 80:80 -e PORT=80 roborally:dev
```

## Rule differences

- no energy cubes & powerups
- 1 reboot token for whole map
  - it wouldn't be that hard to implement multiple reboot tokens, where each of them will have a
    specified rectangle where it is active (and checkpoints will be a fallback). The biggest issue
    I currently see with this is how to indicate that in the frontend
- spawn points are assigned randomly (no player choice)
- running out of SPAM cards isn't supported (yet) (no player choice)
- reboot token has set orientation (no player choice)
  - a drawback of this is that there's now a risk of entering an infinite reboot cycle - we panic
    in that case
- belt movements also sorted by priority antenna (no move-to-same-tile edge-case)
- programming Again after damage card re-executes the substitute action,
  doesn't draw another card (why would anyone ever program cards like that anyway)
- board lasers are always only 1-hit

## TODOs

- fix when bullet from map laser shoots to the same place
- player names above robots
- player name length limit
- fix ping loop holding strong connection reference
- animations: reboot, player move attempt
- belts movement
